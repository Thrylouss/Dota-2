The foundation of the project was taken from the website https://www.dota2.com/home

This is probably my first large project, and I completed almost the entire backend.
Huge thanks to my friend https://github.com/Thrylouss,
who helped me with this project and handled most of the frontend.
In the end, I finished the project and fixed various bugs.
I hope you enjoy this project and find it useful
P.s.
I'm pretty sure that the requirements.txt file contains libraries that aren't being used,
but I'm too lazy to figure out which ones are used and which ones aren't. 
This file is the list of libraries for the Django (Python) backend. 
To install them, just open the project folder and in the command line, type:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure that in this case, the requirements.txt file should be at the same level 
(meaning in the folder where you're located)
